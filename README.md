## 📜 Papers and resources

### 🌺 Biology

#### 🧬  Sequence analysis
* Linked de Bruijn graphs (LdBG)
    * What information do they encode? Why are they useful?
* Biological structure and function emerge from scaling unsupervised learning to 250 million protein sequences
    * How can we continue to extend Transformer and related NLP architectures to biological sequences? Are there even more pre-training tasks we can use?

#### 🌌 Protein folding
* Topological determinants of protein folding
    * What is the right mathematical model to use to develop theory about protein folding?

#### 💻 Computational biology
* Computational genomics course ([YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLpPXw4zFa0uLMHwSZ7DMeLGjIUgo1IBbn))
* IGV Jupyter widgets
* IGV ([User Guide](https://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/UserGuide))
* Bandage ([Documentation](https://github.com/rrwick/Bandage/wiki))
* NCBI Toolbox ([Documentation](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/ToolBox/index.cgi))

#### 🧠 Knowledge bases and datasets
* DrugBank: a comprehensive resource for _in silico_ drug discovery and exploration ([http](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1347430/pdf/gkj067.pdf))

### 🧭 Mathematics
* Why is the number of distinct de Bruijn sequences B(k, n) equal to (k!)^(k^(n-1)) / (k^n)?

### 📊 Data Visualization
